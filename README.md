# Clientside Tabs Challenge

## Setup
### Node

Before you get going make sure you have installed Node.

We recommend [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (especially combined with [this handy gist](https://gist.github.com/sndrs/5940e9e8a3f506b287233ed65365befb)). It is great at managing multiple versions of Node on one machine.

If you prefer to [install Node manually](https://nodejs.org/en/),
check the [.nvmrc](https://github.com/guardian/guui/blob/master/.nvmrc) for the current required version.

### http-server

To run the challenge on your localhost you'll need to install the dependency `http-server` globally:

`npm install -g http-server`

Once you've installed this you can run the command `npm run start` and open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
