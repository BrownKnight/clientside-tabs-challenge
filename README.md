# Clientside Tabs Challenge

## Setup
### Node

Before you get going make sure you have installed Node.

We recommend [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for managing multiple versions of Node on one machine.

### http-server

To run the challenge on your localhost you'll need to install the dependency `http-server` globally:

`npm install -g http-server`

Once you've installed this you can run the command `npm run start` and open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
